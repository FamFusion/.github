# 👩‍💻👨‍💻 FamFusion Team

Welcome to **FamFusion**, a project built by a team of junior Computer Science students at the **University of Maryland**.  

We’re building a family-focused recipe manager think of it like a password manager, but for recipes! Our goal is to create a secure, easy-to-use app where families and friends can share, organize, and preserve their favorite recipes.

## 🚀 What We’re Building
- **FamFusion App** → A full-stack web application with:
  - User profiles with pictures, emails, and preferences
  - Family groups for recipe sharing
  - Tags and categories (e.g., “healthy,” “Mexican”)
  - Favorites and search by name, tag, or contributor
  - Long-term: AI-powered recipe card scanner

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite)  
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)  
- **Database**: SQLite (for dev) → PostgreSQL/MySQL (for deployment)  
- **Hosting**: AWS
